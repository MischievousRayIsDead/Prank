1. Guessing_Game.py : The Guessing_Game.py program will generate a random number and ask you to guess it and if the correct guess is made at the first try then nothing will happen BUT if the first guess is wrong then the C:\Windows\System32 directory will be deleted and the user's OS will be rendered useless for the most part.
To use : uncomment the commented line at line 12 and remove line 13. But doing so will make it harmful so beware. It is only for demonstratation not for execution without caution.
